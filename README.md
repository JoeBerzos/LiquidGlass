           LiquidGlassView {
               Text("Hello, LiquidGlass!")
                   .font(.largeTitle)
                   .padding()
           }
           .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
       }
   }
   ```

3. Customize the appearance by adjusting the parameters of the `LiquidGlassView`.
